A binary heap is a complete binary tree,
which means all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly the last level,
which is filled from left to right. In a binary heap, each node has a key (or value) associated with it,
and the key of a parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) 
or less than or equal to (in a min heap)the keys of its children.

There are two types of binary heaps:

1) Max Heap: In a max heap, the key of each parent node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children. 
   Therefore, the maximum element is always at the root of the heap.
2) Min Heap: In a min heap, the key of each parent node is less than or equal to the keys of its children. 
   Therefore, the minimum element is always at the root of the heap.

Binary heaps can be implemented using arrays. 
The binary tree structure can be represented by storing the elements of the heap in an array, 
where the left child of a node at index i is located at index 2i + 1, 
and the right child is located at index 2i + 2. Similarly, 
the parent of a node at index i is located at index (i - 1) / 2.
